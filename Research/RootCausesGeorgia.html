        <li>Fear of teachers judgement and actions affects academic performanc because students don't feel safe to make mistakes.
        </li><ul>
                <li>“Students described their emotional responses to these teachers [behavior]as govern much of their academic behavior”
                </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students watch teacher behavior and decide how attainable the content is based on what they believe the teacher thinks of the students comprehension and if the student thinks the teacher wants them to learn.</li></ul>                <li>“Teachers who convey they care about students learning or patiently explain material alleviate the anxieties that preclude student performance"</li>
                    <ul><li>Spending time being patient and going over the content will help ease anxieties that get in the way of students wanting to learn or feeling able to do so.</li></ul>
                <li>Implications: Reaching out to students and showing them that a teacher is there to support academic achievement will help students feel positive about being academically vulnerable in order to learn</li>
                    <ul><li>Holding office hours</li>
                    <li>Iterating you are here to help and not to judge</li></ul></ul>
          
            
        <li>Lack of personal identity in classrooms for students and teachers hinders learning.</li>
        <ul><li>“Students wanted teachers to be “people” so that students would feel that they too could be human. The valued teachers saw students as “people” and not just “students,” a role students found limiting.”</li>
                        <ul><li>Many students in study felt that teachers did not show humanity and therefore students were disengaged with the class because they did not feel that the content mended with their life.</li></ul>
                    <li>“Forming an identity is not only a task of adolescence; it is a vital aspect of student life. Relationships with teachers are important contexts for students' efforts to understand themselves; they can provide personal validation and enable necessary reflection.”</li>
                    <ul><li>Putting emphasis on the fact that school is not just for learning information but also is a developmental step in maturing. Teacher presence in student life helps students prepare for the world they are entering and practice human interaction.</li></ul>
                <li>Implications: Individualism and personality is actually part of learning, not something separate. Showing humanity and watching other do the same is important for the development of identity and engagement in learning </li>
                    <ul><li>Incorporate personal experiences in lessons</li>
                    <li>Talk about small struggles individual life as teacher</li>
                    <li>Be open to questions</li>
