    <ol><li>The most effective thing seems to be that it simplifies creating relationships into steps and provides solutions</li>
       <ul><li>Many teachers may not understand why their methods of connections are not working </li>
            <li>Helps more patterned oriented thinkers understand how to create connections</li></ul> 
            <li>The organzation uses technology to broaden the amount of people they provide this education to many</li>
                <ul><li>People are used to using technology to learn</li>
                <li>Technology makes a broader sense of community and in this situation teachers can talk and take advice from one another surronding effective education</li></ul>
                <li>Implication: I can put emphasis on providing solutions on my website and not just giving a space for people to voice their problem</li>
                <li>Implication: The website had a lot of text which made it feel hard to navigate, I want to make sure my website is digustable so that it can be as useful as possible</li>
                <li>Implication: Giving it a helpful purpose for districts to use</li>
